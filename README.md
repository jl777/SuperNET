# BarterDEX Marketmaker V2

This repository contains the `work in progress` code of brand new Marketmaker version built mainly on Rust.  
The current state can be considered as very early alpha.  
**Use with test coins only. You risk to lose your money in case of trying to trade assets with real market cost.**

## Rewrite goals

[MM2 README](mm2src/README.md)

## Project structure

[mm2src](mm2src) - Rust code, contains some parts ported from C `as is` (e.g. `lp_ordermatch`) to reach the most essential/error prone code. Some other modules/crates are reimplemented from scratch.  
[iguana](iguana) - Old C code that is still used and linked to Rust binary. According to gradual port goals this code will be either ported/removed in favor of Rust.  
[crypto777](crypto777) - Additional C libs still required by old iguana/MM1 code.  
[includes](includes) - Additional C headers still required by old iguana/MM1 code.  
[OSlibs](OSlibs) - OS specific libs still required by old iguana/MM1 code.  
 
## How to build

1. Tools required: [Nightly Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), [Cmake 3.12 or higher](https://cmake.org/install/). You will also need your OS specific build tools (e.g. build-essentials on Linux, XCode on OSX or MSVC on Win).
1. (Optional) Linux: install `libboost-dev libboost-system-dev` packages. E.g. `apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-system-dev` on Debian systems.
1. (Optional) OSX: install boost, e.g. `brew install boost`.
1. (Optional) Win: run `marketmaker_build_depends.cmd` to build dependencies.
1. Run `rustup component add rustfmt-preview`.
1. Run `cargo build` or `crago build -vv` to get verbose build output.
